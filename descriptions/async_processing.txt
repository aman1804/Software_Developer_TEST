Why handle file uploads asynchronously?

Uploads can be large and cause timeouts in PHP.
Running tasks synchronously blocks the user experience.


Solution:

Use exec("php process_file.php > /dev/null 2>&1 &") to run in the background.
Use message queues like RabbitMQ or Redis for handling uploads asynchronously.
