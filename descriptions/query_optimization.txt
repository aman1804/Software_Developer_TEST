Why is the query slow?

The WHERE condition filters on status, which isn't indexed.
Sorting (ORDER BY created_at DESC) is slow without an index.



Solution:

Create an index:

CREATE INDEX idx_status_created_at ON orders (status, created_at DESC);

This allows MySQL to quickly locate pending orders and sort them efficiently.
