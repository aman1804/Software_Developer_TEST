Challenges of session management in high-traffic sites:

PHP sessions by default are stored in files, causing performance issues.
Load balancing becomes difficult if sessions are stored on a single server.


Solution:

Store sessions in Redis for faster read/write.
Use sticky sessions if using load balancers.
Configure PHP to use database-backed session storage if necessary.
