Challenges of handling a 5GB CSV file:

High memory usage if all data is loaded at once.
Slow database inserts if done row-by-row.

Efficient Approach:

Use batch processing (inserting multiple rows at a time).
Use fgetcsv() instead of file_get_contents() to process data line by line.
Use indexes in the database for faster insert operations.
