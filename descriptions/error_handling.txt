Why handle unpredictable JSON responses?

JSON can have missing fields, causing undefined index errors in PHP.
Invalid JSON can cause runtime errors.

Best practices:

Always check json_last_error() after decoding.
Use isset() or null coalescing (??) to handle missing fields.
Log errors using error_log() for debugging.
