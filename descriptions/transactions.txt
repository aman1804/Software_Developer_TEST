Why use transactions in e-commerce orders?

A purchase involves multiple inserts: orders, items, payments.
If one step fails, the data should be rolled back to maintain consistency.


How transactions help:

Ensures that either all queries execute or none if there's a failure.
Prevents inconsistent data (e.g., order recorded but payment missing).
Implementation in PHP:

Use begin_transaction(), commit(), and rollback().
