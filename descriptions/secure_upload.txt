Why is file upload security important?

Hackers can upload malicious PHP scripts disguised as images.
File metadata can be manipulated for exploits.


Best practices:

Validate file type (mime_content_type()).
Restrict file size and store in a secure directory.
Prevent direct access to uploaded files.
